The following project was initially made back in 2018 for fun when i was 14,
I later repurposed this code into a qualification coding project, in 2020, where i minimalised the storage capacity further to roughly under 120KB.
This is not the 120KB version as unfortunately that has been whiped without my knowing. 

At the time this served a purpose, that being the evasion of the school's protection systems. 
You see, in order to pass the time, and with only a select few educational websites whitlisted, some people would download games onto USB drives and play them on school computers; however this was later cracked down on by the IT departement. In order to get around this I created a game myself, finding this task equally as fun. I created this small doodle jump style game that while not anything special, impressed my friends and was enough of something todo when it was too cold or hot outside.

The purpose behind minimising the size of this file is due to the fact that we found out this means the "anti-fun" system at the time was unable to detect and thus stop us executing this file. Likely some kind of default size limit for file transfers as a way to stop us filling the system with hundreds of copies of the same game. With us having imported them as simple .txt files and the images via the USB sticks, with those now being some of the few trusted file types; before converting the code file into a python file afterwards to be ran.

Like i said, this isnt anything special, however I wished to place this here for some younger friends whom were asking me what i made for the same course project, that this was later adapted for to which we awkwardly found out once they had access to it, our teacher had been using it as the anonymous example for each year since :)
